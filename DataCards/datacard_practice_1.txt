##Datacard to include the shapes,clear example of how to include shapes in the datacard. In the first block the following line specifies the shape mapping:
The last block concerns the treatment of the systematics affecting shapes. In this part the two uncertainties effecting on the shape are listed.

#In this datacard, the signal is parameterised in terms of the hypothesised mass (MH). Combine will use this variable, instead of creating its own, which will be interpreted as the value for -m. For this reason, we should add the option -m 30 (or something else within the observable range) when running combine. You will also see there is a variable named bkg_norm. This is used to normalize the background rate (see the section on Rate parameters below for details).


In the data/tutorials/shapes/simple-shapes-parametric.txt datacard, there are lines for one such parametric uncertainty,
sigma   param 1.0      0.1
meaning there is a parameter already contained in the input workspace called sigma which should be constrained with a Gaussian centered at 1.0 with a width of 0.1. Note that, the exact interpretation (i.e all combine knows is that 1.0 should be the most likely value and 0.1 is its 1σ uncertainy) of these parameters is left to the user since the signal pdf is constructed externally by you. Asymmetric uncertainties are written as with lnN using the syntax -1σ/+1σ in the datacard.
