# HiggsAnalysis
**Step by Step Higgs Analysis:**

*Step 1*:-
  ## Store the Output from the testing File after training as a root File.
 
 As it is done in the training and testing of signal and backround as in the file, [Storing of ROOT File](https://github.com/raj2022/HiggsAnalysis/tree/main/Codes)

*Step 2*:-
   ## Prepare the Datacard
 
 The data card should be prepare as just like the in [file](https://github.com/raj2022/HiggsAnalysis/blob/main/DataCards/datacard_practice_1.txt).
 Also a example for the signal and background seperation [as in the file](https://github.com/raj2022/HiggsAnalysis/blob/main/DataCards/Datacard_signal_tprime_900_background_ttgg.txt).
